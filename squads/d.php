			<h2>Stroke Development Squads</h2>
			<p>Our stroke development squads are divided into three levels, progressing from E Squad through to C Squad, with focus on developing technique across the four strokes, general water skills and introducing our swimmers to competitive skills such as racing starts and turns.</p>

			<p>Our stroke development coaches are Kevin Burns, Stephanie Trevisan and Vicki Piggott, assisted by a number of assistant and trainee coaches, who work closely with our youngsters.</p>
			<h3>Fees</h3>
			<ul class="list-unstyled">
				<li>Monthly Fee: £38.00</li>

			<p>Fees are payable monthly by standing order. Please could we ask that parents record the swimmer’s name as a reference against payments.</p>
